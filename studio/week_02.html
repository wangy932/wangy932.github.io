Based on the previous discussion, I think the effect of simplification would be the goal I’m after. The past week I did some research on UX and simplification.
<br>
Today we have too many choices. Those choices directly lead to a extreme detailed classification, and thus a high hierarchy in the process logic of different websites and apps, which, on the one hand, is clear and effective. But it definitely sacrifices efficiency when it comes to the most daily tasks, sharing a picture for instance. So I tend to expect more integral design to deal with this issue.
<br>
For example, as a foreign language learner, I frequently use dictionary apps. When you look some words up in an app, basically you have to open that app, type the word, choose the right word on the list, and then add it to your word book. So the interface would keep changing and loading a lot of unnecessary information, and thus take more time. I’ve really suffered from that, and I wish it could be much more time- and labor-saving. So my rough design solution would be: there should only be a search bar, maybe a widget, and when you type a word in, similarly the drop-down menu would show up. You could scroll up and down to find your word. As for each single result, swipe left, and you can preview the basic meaning of it, and swipe left again, you can mark it as a new work you wish to work on later. Reversely, swipe right, and you can remove it from your word book. All these features can be distinguished by color.
<br>
Another example would be file sharing. If you happen to find a picture or video you want to share with one specific friend of yours, now you are supposed to click “share” option, choose the app, choose your friend, click “yes”, and go back. But on the laptop, we just drag and drop, and things would be much easier. Actually there are some mobile operation systems trying to imitate this logic. It is definitely a promising direction. As for sharing information, I want to bring the Instagram case back. I was wondering if we can directly tag the link on the picture since we have already tagged a lot of other stuff on it instead of saying “link in bio.” In either case, there should be a way out with effectiveness and playfulness.
