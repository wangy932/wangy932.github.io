		Based on the previous discussion, I think the effect of simplification would be the goal I’m after. The past week I did some research on UX and simplification.
		<br>
		Today we have too many choices. Those choices directly lead to a extreme detailed classification, and thus a high hierarchy in the process logic of different websites and apps, which, on the one hand, is clear and effective. But it definitely sacrifices efficiency when it comes to the most daily tasks, sharing a picture for instance. So I tend to expect more integral design to deal with this issue.
		<br>
		For example, as a foreign language learner, I frequently use dictionary apps. When you look some words up in an app, basically you have to open that app, type the word, choose the right word on the list, and then add it to your word book. So the interface would keep changing and loading a lot of unnecessary information, and thus take more time. I’ve really suffered from that, and I wish it could be much more time- and labor-saving. So my rough design solution would be: there should only be a search bar, maybe a widget, and when you type a word in, similarly the drop-down menu would show up. You could scroll up and down to find your word. As for each single result, swipe left, and you can preview the basic meaning of it, and swipe left again, you can mark it as a new work you wish to work on later. Reversely, swipe right, and you can remove it from your word book. All these features can be distinguished by color.
		<br>
		Another example would be file sharing. If you happen to find a picture or video you want to share with one specific friend of yours, now you are supposed to click “share” option, choose the app, choose your friend, click “yes”, and go back. But on the laptop, we just drag and drop, and things would be much easier. Actually there are some mobile operation systems trying to imitate this logic. It is definitely a promising direction. As for sharing information, I want to bring the Instagram case back. I was wondering if we can directly tag the link on the picture since we have already tagged a lot of other stuff on it instead of saying “link in bio.” In either case, there should be a way out with effectiveness and playfulness.

		The solution of displaying simplicity without sacrificing functionality is integration. Unnecessary options and <a href="http://blog.kensington.com/kens/multi-device-multitasking-bad-productivity/">multitasking modes</a> could be distracting and thus undermine working efficiency. Integrating those existing functions in a concise manner would be my focal point.
		<br>
		Users can do various things with a search bar or Spotlight Search. The search results of other functions, such as timer setting, or calculation, are integrated into the same webpage or window rather than displaying on a separate one. This logic can also be applied to visual arrangement of interaction design. For instance, by gestures or events, an element can call out different functions, consequently eliminating troublesome experience for users.
		<br>
		A real example would be “the search box” of <a href="http://b.parsons.edu/~wangy932/interface/">my project</a> from last semester. I attempted to employ this idea when depicting my interface for Cooper Hewitt museum. Users are expected to drag the box to decide the maximal size (which would be indicated on the bottom of the column) for the objects they are looking for. By double clicking, a user can also choose the color for his objects. After typing in the key words, he are supposed to attain the results sorted by those three parameters and displayed according to individual sizes from the largest to the smallest. The effect of multitasking is achieved to some extent without displaying redundant information. This interface is merely an attempt to translate verbal information into gestures to obtain conciseness and also playfulness.
