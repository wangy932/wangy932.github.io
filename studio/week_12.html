			<p><em>Eros: The "bastard" son of Aphrodite and the god of love<em>
			<br>
			<br>
			Eros magazine was a collaborative project by American graphic designer, Herbert F. (Herb) Lubalin and Ralph Ginzburg. Other notable magazines that they collaborated on are Fact and Avant Garde. Herb Lubalin was responsible for the creative visuals of the magazines and Ralph Ginzburg was the publisher and editor.
			<br><br>
			In 1962 Eros magazine was launched, creating a, "marriage of love and sex that was routinely ignored in publications." Ralph Ginzburg described the magazine by saying, "To me they often combine (love and sex). Speaking from personal experience, the erotic in my life has always been richest, most fulfilling, when interviewed with love, with the romantic. The investigation and portrayal of this submittal combination is what Eros was all about."
			<br><br>
			This site is dedicated to an article published in the second issue of Eros called, "We All Loved Jack." With very little words the article managed to say a lot. The article reported on the, "much whispered but never overtly discussed sensual appeal of JFK." Compared to other lewd photo spreads, in magazines like Playboy,  "Eros's art and photography portfolios explored eroticism through the historian's and journalist's lens."
