		<p>Designed for the German musician Cro's MTV unplugged album, this website of collection aims for congregating playfulness and convenience of music enjoyment, with the attempt of familiarizing users with the theme of “UNPLUGGED.” The main display part would rely heavily on images ranging from concert posters to artist personal photos, which are under two different categories, namely, “TOUR” and “MERCH.” The other two would be “MUSIC” and “VIDEOS,” composing the navigation area along with the first two categories in the form of audio jacks. Users are expected to unplug the jacks to explore the relevant sections whose basic content would be indicated on the bottom left when the user hover over a certain jack. In the music section, the song list of the album would be provided. Listeners can choose a song from the playlist, and accordingly that would be played with the lyrics showing forth.</p>
